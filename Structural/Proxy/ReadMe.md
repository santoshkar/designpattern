**Proxy pattern**
`Proxy design pattern` is used when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality.

**Difference between Proxy and Adapter Design Patterns**
Adapter object has a different input than the real subject whereas Proxy object has the same input as the real subject. Proxy object is such that it should be placed as it is in place of the real subject.
